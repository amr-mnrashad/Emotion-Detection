# Emotion-Detection
The aim of this project is to perform emotion detection techniques on the given Shakespeare dataset, observe the emotional evolution of each character throughout the play and build an emotional profile for each character that would describe the various types of dominant emotions a character feels.

I have decided to focus on a specific play which is ‘Antony & Cleopatra’. I have tried different emotion detection techniques in order to make comparisons between each technique and how can a character be emotionally represented in the play differently. I have also implemented social network analysis to describe the emotion each character emits when interacting with another person.

In this repository there are 4 files, graph, notebook, paper & presentation.
